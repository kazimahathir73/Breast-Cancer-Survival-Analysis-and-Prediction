# Breast Cancer Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of breast cancer using various machine-learning models. The goal is to explore different algorithms and their effectiveness in predicting breast cancer based on a given dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Data Source & Nature**: Briefly describe the intro.docs file.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Outline the steps taken to preprocess the data, such as cleaning, normalization, and handling missing value.

## Data Exploration
- **Visualization Techniques**: Used matplotlib, sns and other python libraries to visualize the data.
- **Key Insights**: The dataset is divided into three parts and trained three part consecutively to the models

## Models Used
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
- **Random Forest**

## Results
- Accuracy:
  SVM - 0.7769
  KNN - 0.6404
  Random forest - 0.6955
  Logistic Regression - 0.6772
    
- F1 score:
  SVM - 0.6996
  KNN - 0.5324
  Random forest - 0.5323
  Logistic Regression - 0.6019
  
- ROC_AUC score:
  SVM - 0.8094
  KNN - 0.6640
  Random forest - 0.7145
  Logistic Regression - 0.7254


## Conclusion
- Any model can be used as the accuracy level is good
- Support Machine Vector (SVM) is extremely good in term of F1 score

## Future Work
Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques:
  
  Explore more complex algorithms like deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for pattern recognition in breast cancer data.
Investigate ensemble methods that combine multiple models to improve predictive accuracy
